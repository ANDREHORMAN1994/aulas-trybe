    <h3>Jamming to "Fields of Gold" by Sting</h3>
    <p>You'll remember me when the west wind moves<br>
Upon the fields of barley<br>
You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
As we walk in fields of gold
    </p>
    
    <p>So she took her love<br>
For to gaze awhile<br>
Upon the fields of barley<br>
In his arms she fell as her hair came down<br>
Among the fields of gold</p>

    <p>Will you stay with me, will you be my love<br>
Among the fields of barley<br>
We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
As we lie in fields of gold</p>
